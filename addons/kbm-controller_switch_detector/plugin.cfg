name="KBM-Controller_Switch_Detector"
description="Description:
This plugin can detect if input is coming from Keyboard And Mouse or Controller, and can detect what type of controller is being used (Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Steam), it uses a simple autoload so you don't have to do anything else other than just using it!
Usage:
1) When you have to check if the user is currently using a gamepad or a keyboard you can just use: \"KBM_ControllerSwitchDetector.keyboardOrController\" (true if Keyboard is being used, false if Controller is currently being used)
2) When you have to get the controller type, use: \"KBM_ControllerSwitchDetector.controllerType\""
